# Why Python?

## On Python

* Python is free,
* Python is very widely used,
* Python is flexible,
* Python is relatively easy to learn,
* and Python is quite powerful.

## Why not Python?

- Python is a general purpose language used for Scientific Computing. 
- _Not_ to build apps, build software, manage databases, or develop user interfaces. 
- Solve scientific and mathematical problems.

## Python libraries

Scientists often use the following:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/),
* [`numpy` (numerical Python)](https://www.numpy.org/),
* [`matplotlib` (a suite of plotting tools)](https://matplotlib.org/),
* [`scipy` (scientific Python)](https://www.scipy.org/), and
* [`sympy` (symbolic Python)](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).

We'll get to these.

# Running Example

## Diving In

- Taking Python as a given, we'll:
    - Use an example of something I helped a student with recently
    - Show step-by-step how to use Python
    - Introduce a number of Python features to solve the problem more easily.
- This was from an introductory physics class I believe; I don't know the context.

## Motivating Example

- Recently, I helped a student stuck on this:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  9x^2 + 5 & x < 4 \\
  9 & 4 \leq x \leq 8 \\
  2 - x & x > 8
\end{cases}
$$

- Find $f(x)$ for each of the following $x$ values:
$$
\{-1, 4, 5, 8, 11\}
$$

## Is this "real"?

- Models income tax brackets, one of the most important drivers of human behavior in the largest economies in the world.
- We use a simpler contrived example for now...

<table style="font-size:12px">
<th>Marginal Tax Rate</th>
<th>Single Taxable Income</th>
<th>Married Filing Jointly or Qualified Widow(er) Taxable Income</th>
<th>Married Filing Separately Taxable Income</th>
<th>Head of Household Taxable Income</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>10%</th>
<td>$0 – $9,275</td>
<td>$0 – $18,550</td>
<td>$0 – $9,275</td>
<td>$0 – $13,250</td>

## How to solve?

- Think about how you would solve such a problem.
- What steps would you take?
- What would making solving it hard?
    - Keep track of details?
    - Performing the arithmetic?
    - Anything else?
- Python, in my view, is a way to solve these problems.

## Python in action

- My preferred way to do calculation as an experienced Python user is writing *code*:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Mathematical expression
$$
\begin{cases}
  9x^2 + 5 & x < 4 \\
  9 & 4 \leq x \leq 8 \\
  2 - x & x > 8
\end{cases}
$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Python expression (code)

```{python}
9 * -1 * -1 + 5
```

:::

::::

- I write `x * x` for $x^2$ because it's non-obvious how to write "squared" yet.

## Arithmetic Operations

- In Python, we can write many of the same arithmetic operations we use in our math and science classes.
```{python}
6 + 3
```

```{python}
6 - 3
```

```{python}
6 * 3
```

```{python}
6 / 3
```

## Wait?

- Use Python? How?
- To use Python to make this calculation, first we must install Python.
    - It is a program, like Firefox, MS Word or Fortnite

# Installing Python

## Warning!

- There is a very important box to check while installing!
    - Be careful working ahead!
    - We'll teach how to fix not checking this box *but not for a while*

## Installation

- We go to the offial webpage to get an installer for our computer:
    - [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Be careful about starting it!
    - You can open it and check the next slide.

## Add Python to PATH

![](img/add-python-to-path.png)

## Why?

- The benefit of adding Python to path is that we can use it at
- &lt;dramatic music&gt;
- *The Command Line*
    - A text-based interface to computing resources, including its ability to do e.g. arithmetic and save notes.

## Terminal

- On MS Windows
    - I press Windows key, type "terminal" then press enter.
- On MacOS
    - I open Launchpad, type "terminal" then press enter.


## MacOS

![](img/zsh.png)

## Windows

![](img/ps.webp)


## Expression evaluation

- Returning to the terminal, we can type at the "prompt".
- On MacOS, perhaps a line that begins with `$` and a flashing cursor
- On Window, perhaps `PS C:\Users\calvin>`
    - `PS` stands for "powershell" - more latter.
    - `C:\Users\calvin` is the name of a folder - more latter
    - `>` is the prompt, with a flashing cursor.

## "Run" Python

*In the following examples, I remove line numbers to denote they are not Python code snippets.*

- On Windows, type `python`
```{.ps filename="Windows" code-line-numbers="false"}
PS C:\Users\calvin> python
```
- On MacOS, type `python3`
```{.zsh filename="MacOS" code-line-numbers="false"}
$ python3
```
- On both, press the **↵ᴇɴᴛᴇʀ** key.

## See Python

- You'll see something like this:
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
Python 3.12.5 (tags/v3.12.5:ff3bc82, Aug  6 2024, 20:45:27) [MSC v.1940 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
- Take note of the prompt!
- `>>>`
- Those three are how you know it is Python, and not the Terminal, that you are working in.

## Example

- If I type `python` at the command line
- Then `9 * -1 * -1 + 5` *within* Python
- It will look like this:

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
PS C:\Users\calvin> python
Python 3.12.5 (tags/v3.12.5:ff3bc82, Aug  6 2024, 20:45:27) [MSC v.1940 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 9 * -1 * -1 + 5
14
>>>
```

- This is how Python shows that `9 * -1 * -1 + 5` is `14`

# Evaluating Expressions

## Recall

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

$$
\begin{cases}
  9x^2 + 5 & x < 4 \\
  9 & 4 \leq x \leq 8 \\
  2 - x & x > 8
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\{-1, 4, 5, 8, 11\}
$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> 9 * -1 * -1 + 5
14
>>> 9
9
>>> 9
9
>>> 2 - 8
-6
>>> 2 - 11
-9
```

:::

::::

- This is still quite tedious and annoying!

## (In)equality testing

- Like `+` or `-` which we use to calculate numbers...
- We can use `<` or `>` to calculate inequalities.
- Specifically, we see whether an inequality is `True` or `False`

```{python}
-1 < 4
```

```{python}
4 < 4
```

## Accomodating Keyboards

- Some things aren't super easy to type.
- I don't have a "$\leq$" key on my keyboard.
- Combine with `=` as `<=` for "less than or equal" or "$\leq$"

```{python}
4 <= 4
```

- We can "chain" inequalities as well - one after another.
```{python}
4 <= 4 <= 8
```

## A note

- We always put the equal sign `=` second.

```{python}
4 <= 5
```

```{python}
5 >= 4
```
- A (somewhat confusing) error if we try `=>`

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> 4 => 5
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    4 => 5
    ^
SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
```

# `=` and `==`

## New Topics

- We have now touch on two new topics:
    - `True` and `False`
        - Expressions which don't *evaluate* to a number
        - Called "booleans"
    - "Assignment"
        - Associated with the `=` sign
        - Different from inequality testing!
- We'll explore both!

## Booleans

- Sometimes, a Python *expression* is a numerical value.
```{python}
2 + 2
```
```{python}
7
```
- But it doesn't have to be!
```{python}
2 < 2
```

## If

- Booleans are mostly useful for writing `if` statements.
    - These are *multiline* expressions in Python.
- To see the result of multi-line expression, we have to print the result...
```{python}
if (1 <= 1):
    print(2 + 2)
```
```{python}
if (1 < 1):
    print(2 + 2)
```

## Piecewise

- We can see the immediate use of this in a piecewise function!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

$$
\begin{cases}
  9x^2 + 5 & x < 4 \\
  9 & 4 \leq x \leq 8 \\
  2 - x & x > 8
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\{-1, 4, 5, 8, 11\}
$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
if (-1 < 4):
    print(9 * -1 * -1 + 5)
```

- Or least part of one...

```{python}
if (4 < 4):
    print(9 * 4 * 4 + 5)
```

- Uh oh!

:::

::::


## Else

- Oftentimes, we use `if` with `else`

```{python}
if (1 < 1):
    print("1 is less than 1")
else:
    print("1 is not less than 1")
```

## Elif

- If we have more than two options, we can place a special `elif` in the middle.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
if (1 < 1):
    print("1 is less than 1")
elif (1 > 1):
    print("1 is greater than 1")
else:
    print("1 is equal to 1")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
if (2 < 1):
    print("2 is less than 1")
elif (2 > 1):
    print("2 is greater than 1")
else:
    print("2 is equal to 1")
```

:::

::::

- By the way, it is extremely obnoxious to manually type `2` in *5 different places*

## Assignment

- We can also assign variables!
    - I call this *single-equals assignment*
    - Use a single equals sign `=` and some variable name, like `x`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
x = 1
if (x < 1):
    print("x is less than 1")
elif (x > 1):
    print("x is greater than 1")
else:
    print("x is equal to 1")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
x = 2
if (x < 1):
    print("x is less than 1")
elif (x > 1):
    print("x is greater than 1")
else:
    print("x is equal to 1")
```

:::

::::

## Double equals equality

- I call it *single-equals assignment* because sometimes we check if a variable is precisely equal to some value.
- That is somewhat confusingly done with `==` *double equals equality* test.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
x = 1
if (x == 1):
    print("x is equal to 1")
else:
    print("x is not equal to 1")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
x = 2
if (x == 1):
    print("x is equal to 1")
else:
    print("x is not equal to 1")
```

:::

::::

## Double ** Exponentation

- Doubling is used in a few other cases.
- Double asterisk `**` is exponentiation.
```{python}
5 ** 2
```
## Piecewise

- We can finally write the piecewise expression!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

$$
\begin{cases}
  9x^2 + 5 & x < 4 \\
  9 & 4 \leq x \leq 8 \\
  2 - x & x > 8
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\{-1, 4, 5, 8, 11\}
$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
x = 11
if (x < 4):
    print(9 * x ** 2 + 5)
elif (4 <= x <= 8):
    print(9)
elif (x > 8):
    print(2 - x)
```

# Code Reuse

## Recycle

- It is still extremely tedious to either:
    - Copy-paste, or
    - Type more than once.
- Also very annoying/difficult to write them many lines without error!
- We introduce the `def` keyword to define `functions`
- A way to reuse code we have already written.

## `def`

```{python}
def double(x):
    print(x + x)
```
- `def` + *some function name* + `(` + *some variable name* + `):`
```{python}
double(7)
```
- "Call" functions the same way we call `print` - with parens.

## `return`

- It is more common to use `return` than `print` in a function.
- When we call a function, we can think of it as expression with some value.
- That value is defined by the value that is return.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
def six_gt_five_return():
    print(True)
```
```{python}
if (six_gt_five_return()):
    print("it is")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


```{python}
def six_gt_five_print():
    return True
```
```{python}
if (six_gt_five_print()):
    print("it is")
```

:::

::::

## Example

- Suppose an interest rate doubles our savings every ~7 years.
- How much savings in 14 years?

```{python}
savings = 10
savings = double(savings)
savings
```

## Use return

```{python}
def double(x):
    return x + x
```

- Now, `double(savings)` becomes equal to `x + x`

```{python}
savings = 10
savings = double(savings)
savings
```

```{python}
double(savings)
```

- Or even
```{python}
double(double(10))
```

## Piecewise

- We can finally write the piecewise function (was: expression)!
    - Function: use many times in many expressions
    - Expression: evaluate once and get one answer

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

$$
\begin{cases}
  9x^2 + 5 & x < 4 \\
  9 & 4 \leq x \leq 8 \\
  2 - x & x > 8
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\{-1, 4, 5, 8, 11\}
$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
def piecewise(x):
    if (x < 4):
        return 9 * x ** 2 + 5
    elif (4 <= x <= 8):
        return 9
    elif (x > 8):
        return 2 - x
```

```{python}
piecewise(4)
```
:::

::::

# Iteration

## Tedium

- This is still quite tedious.

```{python}
piecewise(-1)
```
```{python}
piecewise(4)
```
```{python}
piecewise(5)
```
```{python}
piecewise(8)
```
```{python}
piecewise(11)
```

## Sets

- This is a *set*:

$$
\{-1, 4, 5, 8, 11\}
$$

- A set is an *unordered* collection of *elements*.
    - In this case, elements are integers - whole numbers.
- Python can also recognize sets!

```{python}
{-1, 4, 5, 8, 11}
```

## Type

- To be sure that is, in fact, a set, we use the helpful built-in `type()` to ask Python.

```{python}
s = {-1, 4, 5, 8, 11}
type(s)
```

- We have also worked with **int**egers.

```{python}
type(1)
```

- And ***bool**eans* - `True` and `False` values.
```{python}
type(1 == 1)
```

## Loops

- With a set, do something *to each element*
- In Python, use a `for` loop:
    - The `for` keyword
    - The name to refer to an element, like `e` or `x`
    - The `in` keyword
    - The set/collection (or its variable name)
    - The `:` colon special character
    - An indented new line of code

## Example

- for element in collection
    - do thing
```{python}
for e in {-1, 4, 5, 8, 11}:
    print(piecewise(e))
```
- What do you see?

## Example

- What if we just try to print the elements?
    - Easier to think about!
```{python}
for e in {-1, 4, 5, 8, 11}:
    print(e)
```
- What do you see?

## Ordering

- Recall: "A set is an *unordered* collection of *elements*".
- We need to put things in order!
- The most common way to do this in Python is with a *list*.
- Almost the same as sets, just use "boxy brackets" `[]`
```{python}
type([1,2,3])
```

## Example

- for element in collection
    - do thing
```{python}
for e in [-1, 4, 5, 8, 11]:
    print(piecewise(e))
```
- What do you see?

## Seeing lists

- We can also use lists to print multiple values!
    - Very helpful for keeping track of things!
```{python}
for e in [-1, 4, 5, 8, 11]:
    print([e, piecewise(e)])
```


## Updating lists

- Each element is a lot like a variable.
    - They just have a name *and* number, use `[]`
    - The initial element is number `0` (*not* 1)
```{python}
xs = [-1, 4, 5, 8, 11]
xs[0]
```
- And like variables, we can assign a value with `=`
```{python}
xs[0] = -2
xs
```

## Adding lists

- Lists also helpfully support addition with `+`
```{python}
[-1] + [4, 5, 8, 11]
```
- We often use this to make new lists.

```{python}
result = []
for e in [-1, 4, 5, 8, 11]:
    result = result + [piecewise(e)]
result
```
- This pattern also works with numbers!
```{python}
x = 0 
x = x + 1
x
```

# Exercise

## Assign-update

- We may use an "assignment operator" `+=`
    - Reassign a variable based on the result of an arithmetic operation.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python} 
x = .10 * 9275
x = x + .15 * (37650 - 9275)
x = x + .25 * (91150 - 37650)
x = x + .28 * (190150 - 91150)
x + .33 * (400000 - 190150)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python} 
x = .10 * 9275
x += .15 * (37650 - 9275)
x += .25 * (91150 - 37650)
x += .28 * (190150 - 91150)
x + .33 * (400000 - 190150)

## Exercise

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Write function
- `def single_tax(pay):`
- *Return* tax cost.
    - Return not print!
- Bonus: Also write `single_tax_rate` which returns the percent tax rate at some income level.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

| Rate   | From    |
|--------|--------:|
| 10%    | 0       |
| 15%    | 9275    |
| 25%    | 37650   |
| 28%    | 91150   |
| 33%    | 190150  |
| 35%    | 413350  |
| 39.6%  | 415050  |

## Solution

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Spoiler alert!

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
def single_tax(pay):
    tax = 0
    if pay > 415050:
        tax += (pay - 415050) * .396
        pay = 415050
    if pay > 413350:
        tax += (pay - 413350) * .35
        pay = 413350
    if pay > 190150:
        tax += (pay - 190150) * .33
        pay = 190150
    if pay > 91150:
        tax += (pay - 91150) * .28
        pay = 91150
    if pay > 37650:
        tax += (pay - 37650) * .25
        pay = 37650
    if pay > 9275:
        tax += (pay - 9275) * .15
        pay = 9275
    return tax + pay * .1

```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- The solution gives the following results!

```{python} 
[
    single_tax(100000),
    single_tax(100000),
    single_tax(200000),
    single_tax(300000),
    single_tax(400000),
]
```

- `115529.25` matches our calculations.

## Challenge Problem

- Calculate at what income does the tax rate reach the second highest marginal tax rate of 35%?
    - That is, at what `pay` does `tax == pay * .35`
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
m = .396
b = 0
b += (415050 - 413350) * .35
b += (413350 - 190150) * .33
b += (190150 - 91150) * .28
b += (91150 - 37650) * .25
b += (37650 - 9275) * .15
b += 9275 * .1
(m * -415050 + b)/(.35 - m)
```


## Bonus Solution

- `single_tax` with loops
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
def single_tax(pay):
    tax_policy = [
        [415050, .396], 
        [413350, .35],
        [190150, .33],
        [91150, .28],
        [37650, .25],
        [9275, .15]
    ]
    tax = 0
    for bracket in tax_policy:
        if pay > bracket[0]:
            tax += (pay - bracket[0]) * bracket[1]
            pay = bracket[0]
    return tax + pay * .1
```
