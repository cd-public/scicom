# Why Neovim?

## On Neovim

* Neovim is free,
* Neovim is very widely available,
* Neovim is highly customizable,
* Neovim is stable, year-on-year,
* and Neovim is quite powerful.

## Why not Neovim?


- **Modal** - it is not a "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor like MS Word, Google Docs, Notepad, or VS Code
- **Terminal-based** - it is used within the terminal and not often as a stand-alone program.
- **Steep-learning curve** - students generally find it difficult to get started, though it is widely briefed by experienced users

# Running Example

## Diving In

- Taking Neovim as a given, we'll:
    - Continue the *piecewise functions* example
    - Touch on Python and the terminal in the context of Neovim
    - Introduce Neovim *modes*, *motions*, and *operators*.
- Spoilers for the last exercise!


## Exercise

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Write function
- `def single_tax(pay):`
- *Return* tax cost.
    - Return not print!
- Bonus: Also write `single_tax_rate` which returns the percent tax rate at some income level.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

| Rate   | From    |
|--------|--------:|
| 10%    | 0       |
| 15%    | 9275    |
| 25%    | 37650   |
| 28%    | 91150   |
| 33%    | 190150  |
| 35%    | 413350  |

## Instead: .py files

- Python has an associated file type, the `.py` file.
    - Similar to `.png` (portable network graphic) for images
    - Similar to `.pdf` (portable document format) for papers

## Test-based

- The `.py` file is much like a `.txt` file in that:
    - It is a small, lightweight file containing only typed characters.
    - It can be opened, edited, and viewed in many editors.
- The `.py` file can save typed code to be used within `python`.

## Enter Neovim

- Neovim is a *great* way to edit text.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Give it a shot!

Students often object to switching from WYSIWYG editors but:

- Many students know *no other way* to write text-based files, and
- We've ample time this term to properly explore Neovim

Be patient, but also work hard!

# Getting Neovim

## Installation

- We go to the offial webpage to get an installer for our computer:
    - [https://neovim.io/](https://neovim.io/)
- Neovim offers a few more installation options than you may be used to.
- I recommend...

## Install from download

Downloads are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) page.

* Latest [stable release](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest)

    * [Windows](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-win64.msi)

## Terminal

- On MS Windows
    - I press Windows key, type "terminal" then press enter.
- On MacOS
    - I open Launchpad, type "terminal" then press enter.

## MacOS

![](img/zsh.png)

## Windows

![](img/ps.webp)

## Expression evaluation

- Returning to the terminal, we can type at the "prompt".
- On MacOS, perhaps a line that begins with `$` and a flashing cursor
- On Window, perhaps `PS C:\Users\calvin>`
    - `PS` stands for "powershell" - more latter.
    - `C:\Users\calvin` is the name of a folder - more latter
    - `>` is the prompt, with a flashing cursor.

## Run Neovim 

*In the following examples, I remove line numbers to denote they are not Python code snippets.*

- On MacOS, type `nvim`
```{.zsh filename="MacOS" code-line-numbers="false"}
$ nvim
```
- On Windows, type `nvim`
```{.ps filename="Windows" code-line-numbers="false"}
PS C:\Users\calvin> nvim
```
- On both, press the **↵ᴇɴᴛᴇʀ** key.

## See Neovim

- You'll see something like this:
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
                  NVIM v0.11.1

  Nvim is open source and freely distributable
           https://neovim.io/#chat

 type :help nvim<Enter>               if you are new!
 type :checkhealth<Enter>             to optimize Nvim
 type :q<Enter>                       to exit
 type :help<Enter>                    for help

type :help news<Enter> to see changes in v0.11

        Help poor children in Uganda!
 type :help iccf<Enter>               for information
```

# Modes

## Modality

- `nvim` is a *modal* text editor
- By default, typed characters will not appear in the document.
- Rather, by default, we being in *command* mode.
- We won't worry about that too much, but the first command to learn is
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
i
```
- `i` for insert

## Insert Mode

- By the way, you should see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the terminal window.
- Insert mode is not unlike WYSIWYG
- Use it prolificly until you are more comfortable.
- Navigate with arrow keys or (depending on system) mouse
- For now, let's copy paste in the `piecewise` function.


## Piecewise

- For me, basic copy/paste commands like:
	- ctrl/cmd+c, ctrl/cmd+v 
	- rclick->menu->copy
- Worked amicably in `i` insert mode

```{.python filename="pw.py"}
def piecewise(x):
    if (x < 4):
        return 9 * x ** 2 + 5
    elif (4 <= x <= 8):
        return 9
    elif (x > 8):
        return 2 - x
```

- For `.py` files I'll include line numbers but add a filename on top.

## Command Mode

- Having written some text, we now need to save it to a file.
- Press the "ESC" (Escape) key to return to command mode
- Your cursor will move the bottom of the terminal, where `-- INSERT --` was

## Remember!

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Remember to press escape!

- In `nvim` examples today, it will not always be easy to make a note of when to press escape!
- As a rule, use escape before anytime you try to do something (exit, save)
- These "do things" usually are `:` prefixed
- Press `i` to get back to typing (insert mode)

:::

## Issuing commands

- After `:w` (write) and the name of the file
- Include the `.py` ending!
- I wrote:
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
:w pw.py
```

## Save and Quit

- You can always use `:w` to save while working.
- Make any edits you make need to make - a missed paren perhaps.
- Then both save *and* exit `nvim` with `:x`
	- This special command saves the file and exits `nvim`
- You will return to the command line you started with, likely without incident.
  	- But there will now be a new file you can use!

# Scripting

## Back in Terminal

- On MacOS, you'll see `nvim` and a new prompt
```{.zsh filename="MacOS" code-line-numbers="false"}
$ nvim
$
```
- On Windows, the same
```{.ps filename="Windows" code-line-numbers="false"}
PS C:\Users\calvin> nvim
PS C:\Users\calvin> 
```

## Aside: Terminal Commands

- Like Python and Neovim, there are also terminal commands!
  - Two are `python`/`python3` and `nvim`!
- Another is `ls`, which stands for "list"
	- This command has been around so long, it is from an era when commands were shorter to save precious computer memory!
- It "lists" local files, and can list them by name!

## Aside: Using `ls`

- Try out this command, to see that you have a `pw.py` file!
```{.ps  code-line-numbers="false"}
$ ls pw.py
```
- What do you see (different on Windows and MacOS)?

## Checkpoint

- If you do not have a `pw.py` file, stop here until you have one!
```{.ps filename="Windows" code-line-numbers="false"}
PS C:\Users\calvin> ls pw.py


    Directory: C:\Users\cd-desk


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         5/20/2025   3:21 PM            151 pw.py
```
```{.zsh filename="MacOS" code-line-numbers="false"}
$ ls pw.py
pw.py
$
```

## .py files

- There are two common ways to use `.py` files
- I believe the most common is via `import`
- To begin, at the command line, start Pythoni

- On Windows, type `python`
```{.ps filename="Windows" code-line-numbers="false"}
PS C:\Users\calvin> python
```
- On MacOS, type `python3`
```{.zsh filename="MacOS" code-line-numbers="false"}
$ python3
```
- On both, press the **↵ᴇɴᴛᴇʀ** key.

## See Python

- You'll see something like this:
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
Python 3.12.5 (tags/v3.12.5:ff3bc82, Aug  6 2024, 20:45:27) [MSC v.1940 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
- Take note of the prompt!
- `>>>`
- Those three are how you know it is Python, and not the Terminal, that you are working in.

## Import

- Versus last time, we now have a piecewise function written in a `.py` file we can reference.
- To do so, we:
	- Type `import` followed by a space
	- Type the filename less the `.py` *extension*
	- It should look like this:

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
PS C:\Users\calvin> python
Python 3.12.5 (tags/v3.12.5:ff3bc82, Aug  6 2024, 20:45:27) [MSC v.1940 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pw
>>>
```

## Modules

- `import pw` will introduce a new variable to Python to which we can refer by name (pw)
- It is of a new type for us, "module"
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> type(pw)
<class 'module'>
```
- Modules correspond to `.py` files!
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> pw
<module 'pw' from 'C:\\Users\\calvin\\pw.py'>
```
- (The `from` will look different on different computers)

## Importing Functions

- We can use functions inside modules in a few ways.
- First, we can use the module name (`pw`) followed by a dot or period (`.`) followed by the name of the function.
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> pw.piecewise(-1)
14
```

## Renaming Functions

- Second, we can just use single equals assignment
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> piecewise = pw.piecewise
>>> piecewise(4)
9
```

## Using `from`

- Third, we can use the `from` keyword in our import.
	- This is *by far* preferred (it is more clear)

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> from pw import piecewise
>>> piecewise(11)
-9
```

- I only show you the other methods to make it clear what this method is doing.

## Exit Python

- Oftentimes, we'll run a bit of Python then want to go back to the command line to use `nvim`

::: {.callout-tip}

## `exit()`

You can exit the Python `>>>` prompt back to Windows `>` or MacOS `$` at any time:

- Use `exit()` 
- Use `quit()`
- Use ctrl/cmd+z

Practice starting and leaving Python a few times!

:::

# Using Terminal

## Command Line Utilities

I find the following tedious:

1. `nvim`
2. Write some code
3. `:w somefile.py`
4. ESC then `:x`
5. `python`
6. `from somefile import somefunction`
7. `somefunction(x)`
8. `exit()`

## Alternative

- We will instead:
  - Show how to how run script files
  - Show how to provide input to script files

## Hello, Terminal

- To begin, we will do terminal "Hello, World!"
- I use `nvim hi.py` to create *and* open a new file named `hi.py`
- Then I write:
```{.py filename="hi.py"}
print("Hello, terminal!")
```

## Running Scripts

- I save and exit via `:x`
- Then I run the Python script via `python hi.py`
- For me, it looks like this:
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
$ nvim hi.py
$ python3 hi.py
Hello, terminal!
$
```

## What happened?

- Basically, Python runs the code written in the file as if it were entered at the prompts.
- It then provides the expected print statements.
- We can run multiple times without rewriting the script.

## Piecewise Script

- Say we wish to find the piecewise results from the prior lecture.
- `nvim pw.py`
- I use `G` to jump to the end of the file
	- This is a "vim motion"
- I use `i` to change into insert mode, and add:
```{.py filename="pw.py"}
for e in [-1, 4, 5, 8, 11]:
    print([e, piecewise(e)])
```
- Save and exit with (escape then) `:x` 

## Test it

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
$ nvim pw.py
$ python3 pw.py
[-1, 14]
[4, 9]
[5, 9]
[8, 9]
[11, -9]
$
```

## Using input

- Fortunately, Python has a built-in function that is (basically) the opposite of `print`
- Within the terminal, run `python`
- Then within Python, call `input()`
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> input() 
```
- What happens?

## What if?

- We want to be able to check values without either
  - Opening `python` and doing an `import`, or
  - Opening `nvim` and editing the list
- We can do that by providing *input*
  - We write a script that expects us to type in some information!

## Python input

- Python helpfully has an input that is basically the opposite of print.
- `input`
- It is easiest to learn by trying it out!

## Providing input

- Open Python
- Call the function `input()`
- Type something - anything - then press enter.


```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> input()
something anything
'something anything'
```

- *The `input()` function **returns** the text that is typed in*

## Script input

- Let's make a little script to try out `input()`
```{.py filename="reply.py"}
x = input()
print(x)
```
- Think about the steps to create and run this file!

## Example

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
$ nvim
$ python3 reply.py
I wrote this text then pressed enter.
I wrote this text then pressed enter.
$
```

- Try it out!

## Return v. Print

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Print, Not Return

- To see the results of some expression or computation other work in the terminal, we must `print` within scripts.
- `print()` for terminal
- `return` within Python

:::

# Datatypes

## A Wrinkle

- There's one little problem here.
- Let's update `pw.py` to to run on `input()` and see what happens.
```{.py filename="pw.py"}
def piecewise(x):
    if (x < 4):
        return 9 * x ** 2 + 5
    elif (4 <= x <= 8):
        return 9
    elif (x > 8):
        return 2 - x

x = input()
y = piecewise(x)
print(y)
```

## Uh oh!

- I see the following:

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
$ python3 pw.py
10
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/user/pw.py", line 10, in <module>
    y = piecewise(x)
  File "/home/user/pw.py", line 2, in piecewise
    if (x < 4):
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
$
```

## Recall

- We worked with different types last time:
	- *Think about what is happening here*
```{python}
[type(1), type(1 == 2), type([1,2]), type({1,2})]
```
- The type of `input()` is a new type - `str`
  - Short for "string" - as in string of characters
```{python}
type("Hello, world!")
```

## Casting

- Changing data of one type (like `str`) into another (like `int`) is called *casting*
- In Python, to cast we use the name of the type we want as a function on the value in the type we *don't* want.
- Easy to try within `python`

## Try it

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> x = input()
10
>>> x
'10'
>>> type(x)
<class 'str'>
>>> y = int(x)
>>> y
10
>>> type(y)
<class 'int'>
>>> y < 11
True
```

- Python shows something is a string by enclosing it within quote marks `''`

## Fix `pw.py`

```{.py filename="pw.py"}
def piecewise(x):
    if (x < 4):
        return 9 * x ** 2 + 5
    elif (4 <= x <= 8):
        return 9
    elif (x > 8):
        return 2 - x

x = input()
y = int(x)
z = piecewise(y)
print(z)
```

## Use it

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
$ nvim pw.py
$ python3 pw.py
10
-8
$ python3 pw.py
-1
14
$
```

# Exercise

## Income Tax

- We'll return to the income tax example, and
- Add a wrinkle.
- Here's an income tax solution:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
def single_tax(pay):
    tax_policy = [
        [415050, .396], 
        [413350, .35],
        [190150, .33],
        [91150, .28],
        [37650, .25],
        [9275, .15]
    ]
    tax = 0
    for bracket in tax_policy:
        if pay > bracket[0]:
            tax += (pay - bracket[0]) * bracket[1]
            pay = bracket[0]
    return tax + pay * .1
```

## Arguments

- There is one other way to specify what you want a script to do.
- *Command line arguments*
- This is my favorite way (simpliest to use)
	- (Bit harder to write)
- It is based on the Python `sys` module

## `sys`

- Create and try out the following file:
```{.py filename="args.py"}
import sys

print(sys.argv)
```
- What does it do?

## 'argv'

- 'argv' stands for "argument vector"
- You may have noticed it is a list
  - Other programming languages sometimes call lists vectors
  - *Computer systems* often call lists vectors
  - Python follows this convention

## Add an arg

- What happens if you do this?

```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
$ python3 args.py hello world
```

## Remember!

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Lists begin with zero! 

- When using `argv`, recall it is a Python list!
- The initial element - what we would often call first - is at position *zero*
- Would would print *only this element* as follows:

```{.py filename="args.py"}
import sys

print(sys.argv[0])
```

:::


## Exercise

- Create a file `tax.py`
- Have it accept an income as a *command line argument*
- Have it print a tax cost at command line.
- Here's an example how it should work!
```{.email code-line-numbers="false"}
$ python3 tax.py 40000
115529.25
```

## Challenge Problem

- Accept two command line arguments
  - Income, and
  - One of `['single', 'married', 'separate', 'head']`
- Print the tax regardless of "single-ness"

## Solution

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
```{.python}
import sys

print(single_tax(int(sys.argv[1])))
```
</details>
