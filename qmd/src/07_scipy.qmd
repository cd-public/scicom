# What is SciPy?

> [SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is an open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html)

* **Sci**entific **Py**thon
* Basically a NumPy extension.

## Why SciPy 

* Most popular scientific computing platform in the world.
* Basis of scikit-learn, the most popular machine learning platform in the world.
* Extremely rigorous - most functions and documentation come with academic citations.

## Why not SciPy

- SciPy for statistics has basically one challenger (statsmodels, which is great).
- Sometimes SciPy is too "heavyweight" and NumPy would be sufficient.
- As a rule, I tend to use NumPy for easy things and scikit-learn for hard things, and don't use SciPy for much.

## Relevance

- This is a scientific computing course!
- We'll do a bit of signal processing and interpolation.

## Credits

- SciPy is a big, complex library with many components.
- I used each of:
  	- The [User Guide](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/index.html)
	- The [API reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html)
	  	- API is "application program interface" - a description of the functions in SciPy by their arguments and return values.
	- The [Cookbook](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/) which may be unofficial.

# Install

## pip again

- Just like NumPy, Matplotlib is a Python package which we install via `pip`
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
python3 -m pip install scipy
```
- That might take a moment, when it does we can check it worked!

## Verify

- We can quickly verify installation and introduce some conventions.
- Open up Python and import the libraries:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy

print(scipy.__version__)
```

# Other Installs

## Motivation

- I thought it would be fun to do some signal processing on a recognizable data set:

## Problem Statement

- SciPy has the ability to read some filetypes but not others.
  	- Can read: ".wav" Waveform Audio File Format.
	- Can't read: YouTube urls
- We use Python package `yt-dlp` to download from YouTube.
- We use non-Python package `ffmpeg` to translate .mp4 files to .wav
- We use VideoLAN VLC Media Player to play the .wav files.

## Note

- You do not need to download any of these.
- Here is the .wav:
	- <audio controls src="src/psy.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio> 
- Here is a link: 
  	- [psy.wav](psy.wav)

## yt-dlp

- While I don't think you need it for anything, I installed `yt-dlp` as follows, from the shell:
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
python -m pip install yt-dlp
```

## ffmpeg

- I believe this is the best place to download `ffmpeg` for Windows and MacOS.
- [https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- I used it on Ubuntu Linux and did not attempt and Windows or MacOS install.

## Download

- Both `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are command line utilites (like Python, Neovim, or `ls`).
- I didn't actually ever use `ffmpeg` directly, it is just used by `yt-dlp`.
- Given the url, I used the following shell command:
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
yt-dlp -x --audio-format wav https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0 -o psy.wav
```
- This tells `yt-dlp` to go to the url, download to video, convert it to a .wav, and save it as "psy.wav"

## VLC

- I *highly* recommend having VLC installed.
- [https://www.videolan.org/vlc/#download](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/#download)

## curl

- As an alternative, you can `curl` the file from the course webpage.
- `curl` is a shell command that downloads a file from a url.
  	- Can also be used to get e.g. the ".csv" file we used with **pandas**!
```{.bash code-line-number="false"}
curl https://github.com/cd-public/scicom/raw/refs/heads/main/qmd/src/psy.wav -o psy.wav
```
- This directs the command line to download the file from the url and save it locally as "psy.wav"

# `scipy.io`

## wavfile

- To load a wavfile into SciPy, it is a simple matter.
- But first, we note one difference:
  	- With NumPy, we imported as `np`
	- With **pandas**, we import as `pd`
- With Matplotlib, we imported Matplotlib "dot" something - pyplot
  	- The "Python interface"

## SciPy Modules

- SciPy is composed of many *modules*
- `matplotlib.pyplot` is a previous example of a module.
- For example:
  	- `scipy.io` includes ways to read files.
	- `scipy.fft` does Fast Fourier Transforms.
	- `scipy.stats` does statistics.

## Load "psy.wav"

- We will load a sound file as an np.array.
```{python}
rate, data = scipy.io.wavfile.read("psy.wav")
```
- This may look odd!

## Multiple return

- This uses a slightly advanced Python topic of "multiple return".
```{python}
def roots(x):
	root = np.sqrt(x)
	return -root, root
```
- Python can return multiple comma-separated values from a function.
```{python}
neg, pos = roots(25)
[neg, pos]
```
- We can "unpack" the multiple values by providing comma separated variable names.

## Aside: Tuples

- These multiple returns are just tuples.
	- The things that are like lists, but not exactly.
```{python}
both = roots(64)
type(both)
```
- We can also use indexing to see individual elements of a tuple.
```{python}
both[0]
```

## vs. Lists

- The only difference compared to lists is updates.
- In a list, we can change an element with its index:
```{python}
color_lst = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
color_lst[-1] = "purple"
color_lst
```

## Aside: Errors

- Doing this to a list would create an error.
- Thus far we have avoided showing example code that won't work.
- We can use `try` and `except` (like `if` and `else`) on erroneous code.
```{python}
color_tup = tuple(color_lst)
try:
	color_tup[-1] = "violet"
except:
	print("Tuples can't do that.")
```

## Reading files

- Try except is *very* handy when reading files.
- A lot of files I try to read are garbled and can't be read.
- Using `try` and `except` prevents Python errors.
  	- More useful in big scripts than single-line things.

## Example

- Earlier today, I tried the `curl` command to get "psy.wav" while (unbeknownst to me) my internet was spotty.
- I got a file named "psy.wav" that was of size `0`
- Unsurprisingly, opening it with SciPy led to an error.
- This happens all the time!

## Data

- Back to our .wav file.
- Let's look at that data!
```{python}
data[:10]
```

## Rate

```{python}
rate
```

- You may have listened to the file (or not).
- Audio doesn't come in for about 4 seconds.
- The song ends and there's a kind of "outro".
- We can see these on the plot.
- But that examples the zeros.

## Plot

```{python}
plt.plot(data)
```

## Back to Data

- Given the rate, we can look at values ever `rate` amount of time.
- I bet it's seconds, so we'll see 3 or 4 zero-only then some non-zero.
```{python}
data[:rate*10:rate]
```

## Why pairs?

- Those two values may look initially suspicious, then I remembered.
- Many mammals, including some assistant professors of computer science, have two ears!
- This is a stereo file - the pairs are for each of two speakers.

## Test it

- Don't believe me?
- Let's split into a "left" and "right" file.
- We needn't necessarily get the labels right, but these are simply NumPy operations.
- Then listen!

## Transpose

- Remember `.transpose`?
- It will take an array of pairs and make a pair of arrays.
```{python}
tpose = data.transpose()
tpose[0][:rate*10:rate]
```

## Split

- I will arbitrarily call one "left" and one "rite" (not "right" because we don't know if we're right).
```{python}
left = tpose[0]
rite = tpose[1]
```

## Zeros

- We'll also make a zero-only array of the same length.
```{python}
# We note the "dtype" was "int16" so we do the same.
# We do have to be clear it's NumPy int16 though!
zero = np.zeros(len(left),dtype=np.int16)
```

## Combine

- We can make left-only and rite-only arrays via:
  - Combine
  - Transpose

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


```{python}
left_only = np.array([left,zero]).transpose()
left_only[:rate*10:rate]
```


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
rite_only = np.array([zero,rite]).transpose()
rite_only[:rate*10:rate]
```

:::

::::


## Save

- Let's write/save both then give 'um a listen.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


```{python}
scipy.io.wavfile.write("left.wav", rate, left_only)
```


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
scipy.io.wavfile.write("rite.wav", rate, rite_only)
```

:::

::::

## Listen 

- Let's write/save both then give 'um a listen.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}



<audio controls src="src/left.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio> 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


<audio controls src="src/rite.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

# Noise

## Noise Reduction

- In a way, all sound is noise.
- Let's try and isolate the vocals and music, regarding the other variously as noise at various points.
- First identify where vocals come in.
- To me, 0:04 to 0:09 seems instrumental.

## View it

- Look for patterns

```{python}
snip = left[4*rate:10*rate]
plt.plot(snip)
```

## Repeats?

- Looks like volume cuts low on a repeated pattern.
- Maybe we can isolate that pattern.
- Let's:
  	- Pick a range
	- Find a minimal value
	- Find where that value occurs.
```{python}
low_val = min(snip)
low_val
```

## Whoops!

- Oh we need to use absolute value.
- No worries!
```{python}
low_val = min(np.absolute(snip))
low_val
```

# Where?

- Use `np.where` to find where the low values occur.
  	- We used with [**pandas**](06_pandas.qmd#metallic)
```{python}
lows = np.where(snip == 0)
lows
```

## Patterns

- Maybe there's something repeating on a periodicity of like... 65k?

```{python}
# We note that the result was enclosed in () so we get the [0] of it.
lows = lows[0]
# Then proceed
lows = lows[np.where(lows > 500)]
lows
```

## Visualize

- Let's just plot the place the minimum occurs.
```{python}
_ = plt.hist(lows)
```

## More Bins

- Hard to see, we increase the "bin" count.
```{python}
_ = plt.hist(lows, 100)
```

## A Pattern?

```{python}
_ = plt.hist(np.where(left == 0))
```

- Only before vocals enter?

## Isolate

- Let's see if we can isolate a motif.
- We'll take the first zero past.
- I hear about two repeats on this portion, so we'll take a zero in the middle.
```{python}
np.where(snip == 0)
```

## Motif

```{python}
stereo = np.array([snip,snip]).transpose()
motif = stereo[13580:131204]
scipy.io.wavfile.write("motif.wav", rate, motif)
# os.system("open motif.wav") # After import, if you have VLC, on MacOS
```

<audio controls src="src/motif.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio> 

```{python}
other = stereo[13580:271632]
scipy.io.wavfile.write("other.wav", rate, other)
```

<audio controls src="src/motif.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio> 

```{python}
scipy.io.wavfile.write("motifs.wav", rate, np.concat([motif,motif,motif]))
scipy.io.wavfile.write("others.wav", rate, np.concat([other,other,other]))
```

<audio controls src="src/motifs.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio> 

<audio controls src="src/others.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

## FFT

- The actual correct way to do this is with a SciPy FFT:
  	- [Fast Fourier Transform](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/fft.html)
- And with a NumPy stride:
  	- [Stride Tricks](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.lib.stride_tricks.html)
- Which is probably a bit much for now.

# Stats

## Linear Regression

- One of the most used computation techniques is linear regression.
- It is used throughout the sciences, but most commonly in econometrics.
- In my my undergraduate economics class, I had a homework assignment to "prove" that raising minimum wage increases unemployment.
  	- It doesn't, but that isn't relevant here.

## The Data

- I usually get economic data from the "St. Louis Fed" which has a data portal called "FRED".
  - Minimum wage [FEDMINNFRWG](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDMINNFRWG)
  - Unemployment rage [UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)
  - Inflation [CPIAUCSL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)

## Curl

- It is actually possible to `curl` these but you probably have to navigate the websites to find the urls regardless.
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
curl https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?bgcolor=%23ebf3fb&chart_type=line&drp=0&fo=open%20sans&graph_bgcolor=%23ffffff&height=450&mode=fred&recession_bars=on&txtcolor=%23444444&ts=12&tts=12&width=1140&nt=0&thu=0&trc=0&show_legend=yes&show_axis_titles=yes&show_tooltip=yes&id=FEDMINNFRWG&scale=left&cosd=1938-10-01&coed=2025-05-01&line_color=%230073e6&link_values=false&line_style=solid&mark_type=none&mw=3&lw=3&ost=-99999&oet=99999&mma=0&fml=a&fq=Monthly&fam=avg&fgst=lin&fgsnd=2020-02-01&line_index=1&transformation=lin&vintage_date=2025-05-31&revision_date=2025-05-31&nd=1938-10-01 -o FEDMINNFRWG.csv

```

## From url

- Given some url with Python 
  - `url = "https://..."`
- You can of course also:
  - **pandas** `pd.read_csv(url)`
  - "os" `os.system("curl " + url + " -o name.csv")
