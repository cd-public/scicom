# What is SciPy?

> [SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is an open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html)

* **Sci**entific **Py**thon
* Basically a NumPy extension.

## Why SciPy 

* Most popular scientific computing platform in the world.
* Basis of scikit-learn, the most popular machine learning platform in the world.
* Extremely rigorous - most functions and documentation come with academic citations.

## Why not SciPy

- SciPy for statistics has basically one challenger (statsmodels, which is great).
- Sometimes SciPy is too "heavyweight" and NumPy would be sufficient.
- As a rule, I tend to use NumPy for easy things and scikit-learn for hard things, and don't use SciPy for much.

## Relevance

- This is a scientific computing course!
- We'll do a bit of signal processing and interpolation.

# Install

## pip again

- Just like NumPy, Matplotlib is a Python package which we install via `pip`
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
python3 -m pip install scipy
```
- That might take a moment, when it does we can check it worked!

## Verify

- We can quickly verify installation and introduce some conventions.
- Open up Python and import the libraries:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy

print(scipy.__version__)
```

# Other Installs

## Motivation

- I thought it would be fun to do some signal processing on a recognizable data set:

## Problem Statement

- SciPy has the ability to read some filetypes but not others.
  	- Can read: ".wav" Waveform Audio File Format.
	- Can't read: YouTube urls
- We use Python package `yt-dlp` to download from YouTube.
- We use non-Python package `ffmpeg` to translate .mp4 files to .wav
- We use VideoLAN VLC Media Player to play the .wav files.

## Note

- You do not need to download any of these.
- Here is the .wav:
<audio controls>
  <source src="psy.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio> 
- Here is a link: [psy.wav](psy.wav)

## yt-dlp

- While I don't think you need it for anything, I installed `yt-dlp` as follows, from the shell:
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
python -m pip install yt-dlp
```

## ffmpeg

- I believe this is the best place to download `ffmpeg` for Windows and MacOS.
- [https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- I used it on Ubuntu Linux and did not attempt and Windows or MacOS install.

## Download

- Both `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are command line utilites (like Python, Neovim, or `ls`).
- I didn't actually ever use `ffmpeg` directly, it is just used by `yt-dlp`.
- Given the url, I used the following shell command:
```{.bash code-line-numbers="false"}
yt-dlp -x --audio-format wav https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0 -o psy.wav
```
- This tells `yt-dlp` to go to the url, download to video, convert it to a .wav, and save it as `psy.wav`
